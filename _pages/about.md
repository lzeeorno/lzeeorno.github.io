This is the front page of a website that showcases my academic journey and research contributions. I am currently a PhD student at CAS (SIAT) and the University of Macau, focusing on Computer Vision and Medical Imaging.

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, this site is designed to separate content from form, allowing for efficient updates and management of my academic portfolio.

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right.
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata.
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory.
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section.
